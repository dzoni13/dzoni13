ðŸ‘‹ Hi, welcome to my profile, feel free to check out some of my personal work.

If you follow this link:"https://coffee-restaurant-website.herokuapp.com/", it will lead you to an web application that I have designed and develop from scratch.

If you are interested in a celebration of some kind, I can provide you with a username and password to log in like Admin,
there are some cool functionalities that this kind of website's usually doesn't have. 

Iâ€™ve been developing Web e-commerce applications and designing UI for over 2 years now. Once a project is in my hands, I cut no corners. 

Over the past 2 years, I have worked on developing a range of different websites using primarily HTML5/CSS3, SQL, React, Next.js and Javascript. 
My past work includes websites for startup companies, small businesses, and individuals. I truly enjoy developing, coding, and maintaining clean, professional,
and easy-to-navigate websites.

I can help with the following:
1) CSS3
2) HTML5
3) Next.js
4) React
5) MySQL
6) jQuery
7) JavaScript
8) MongoDB
9) Website developing
10) Creating responsive sites 
11) Graphic design
12) UI - UX
13) SEO

If you have any questions, feel free to let me know. 
I like working with people to bring their ideas to life.
